## `COVIDCurve` Purpose
The purpose of this "package" is to provide a framework to fit age-specific infection fatality ratios (IFRs) in an epidemic under several key assumptions. The model was originally designed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (hence the name). 

```{r setup}
library(COVIDCurve)
```
