Description: In many settings, individual-based (i.e. "line-list") data are often unavailable or unreliable. Here we use 
             aggregated death counts to infer the infection fatality ratio or the number of individuals infected at
            "time zero" in the epidemic and the current day of the epidemic. Models are fit within a Bayesian framework
            and account for the epidemic growth rate.
